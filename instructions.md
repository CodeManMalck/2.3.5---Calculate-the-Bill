Write a function called `calculateBillTotal`.

Given the pre-tax/pre-tip amount of a meal, this function returns the total amount due after tax and tip.

**Notes**:

- Assume that sales tax is 9.5% and tip is 20%.
- Do NOT tip on the sales tax, only on the pre tip amount.

```
var output = calculateBillTotal(20);
```

```
console.log(output);  // will print 25.9
```
